			<h1>So, what is it?</h1>
			<p>
				You’ve probably heard the word “insurance”
				advertised on the TV, radio, newspapers and
				even in some magazines. Companies try and
				sell it to you when you buy a cell phone, a piece
				of furniture or maybe when you take out a loan
				or new bond to buy a house.<br><br>
				
				But what is insurance, why do you need it,
				and how do you know if what you are buying
				is suitable for you? <br><br>
				
				Insurance is the transfer of risk from one party
				to another. But what do we mean by risk?
				Specifically, in the short-term insurance
				industry, when we talk about risk we mean the
				potential to make a financial loss from an
				unexpected event (such as a burglary or
				accident).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 colm2 consumer6Right">
			<p>
				The financial loss can be for
				anything; indeed, there is insurance available
				for almost any loss you may suffer that you can
				imagine. <br><br> 
				
				Short-term or non-life insurance,
				protects you and your assets from the financial
				risk of something going wrong. It can’t stop
				something happening, but if something
				unexpected does happen that is covered by
				your policy, it means you won’t have to pay the
				full cost of a loss.<br><br>
			
				An example of a financial loss is the price to
				replace a TV that has been stolen from your
				house while you were at work. Or perhaps it is
				the price for a panel beater to fix your bumper
				after you accidentally bumped into a car while
				trying to parallel park. 
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row consumerRow3">
		<div class="col-md-6 colm1">
<!-- 			<h1>So, What is it?</h1> -->
			<p>
				Once you have bought an insurance
				product, you are then referred to as a
				POLICYHOLDER (as you now hold an
				insurance policy), and are COVERED by
				the insurance company for any event/s
				that results in a loss and are
				specifically mentioned in the insurance
				policy document
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 colm2 consumer6Right">
			<p>
				As you can see, the purpose of short-term
				insurance is to put you in the SAME FINANCIAL
				POSITION you were in BEFORE the loss
				happened. <br><br> 
				
				This is what we mean by the transfer
				of risk. Instead of you having to lose money
				because something unfortunate happened,
				insurance allows you to transfer this risk to the
				insurance company, who will instead pay out this
				loss on your behalf (or perhaps reimburse you
				for the amount you have already paid).<br><br>
			
				This transfer of risk is not free, and is bought
				with what are called PREMIUMS. This is
				essentially the price of the insurance, and can
				be paid with regular instalments (e.g. monthly)
				or in a single amount.

			Essentially what insurance does is it moves the risk of an UNCERTAIN FUTURE LARGE LOSS to
			the insurance company in return for small payment in the form of a premium. Therefore, the
			question is: “Would I rather MAYBE pay out R500 000 sometime in the future if my house burnt
			down, or DEFINITELY pay a monthly premium and not have to pay out a large amount if an
			accident happens?”

				Some people may save enough money in their bank
				accounts to be able to afford unfortunate future
				events, and would have to consider what kind of
				insurance, if any, is suitable for them.</p>

			<p>These numbers are examples and are just being
				used to show how insurance can reduce a large,
				potential future loss, into a small, certain premium.
				The question on whether to buy insurance depends
				on what we, in the insurance industry, call a
				person’s RISK AVERSION.</p>	
			
			<p>
				This means that people who dislike uncertainty and
				riskiness would be more keen to buy insurance (as
				they reduce the risk of having to pay out unexpected
				large losses) and people who prefer to gamble and
				take chances would be less keen to buy insurance
				(as they would take a chance that if they don’t buy
				insurance, nothing unfortunate will happen to them
				in the future. They also would not mind being
				without a TV or drive around in a dented car).

			<p>The first thing to think about when deciding if an
				insurance product is suitable for you is if you can
				afford it. If the premiums are too high compared
				to your monthly income, it may not make sense
				for you to buy it. However, if the premiums are
				affordable, the main question to ask is if the
				premiums you are paying would still be less than
				the eventual loss you may suffer. 
				
				<br><br>
				Let’s say you have an accident in 3 years and it
				costs R150 000 to fix your home and if premiums
				cost R64 a month, then over the 3 years you
				would have paid about R2304 in premiums (R64 x
				12 months x 3 years). So you would have received
				R150 000 in benefits for loss of R2304, and
				therefore you have benefitted from insurance
				cover.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 consumer6Right">
			<p>
				However, to do the above calculation when you are deciding to take out an insurance policy is very difficult
			as there are many factors to consider (premium inflation, the exact financial losses you are covered for,
			excesses – we will discuss this later, etc.). Also, because the events you are covering with insurance are
			by nature unknown, and may not even occur (e.g. you may never have an accident to your home),
			predicting what this may be is very difficult. So, a better way to decide whether insurance is suitable for
			you may be to simply decide if, after deciding if the premiums are affordable, does insurance give you
			peace of mind? In other words, once you have bought your insurance, does the fact that you no longer
			have to worry about how you will pay for unexpected bills make you feel more comfortable and help to
			relieve your stress? If the answer to this is yes, then insurance may be suitable for you.

			<p>
				Selecting an insurance company can be a
				tricky process and can be based on any
				number of reasons, including whether you
				like one insurance company more than
				another. The best insurer may not
				necessarily be the one with the cheapest
				premiums, but may be the one with the best
				reputation. After chatting to colleagues,
				friends and family, you may get a better idea
				of which insurers treat their customers the
				best. However it may be good to keep in mind
				that some people may feel that they have
				been mistreated by insurers, when they were
				in fact the ones to blame! So it’s important to
				get the whole story when someone has had a
				bad experience with an insurance company.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 consumer6Right">
			<p>
				Choosing an insurance company goes
				hand-in-hand with choosing the right insurance
				product. Some insurers may offer products and
				added benefits that other insurers don’t, and the
				value of these products should be considered as
				well as the reputation of the insurer. There are
				websites available that can compare the
				premiums charged for a certain insurance
				product (e.g. motor insurance) between different
				insurance companies – these are called price
				aggregators. These can help you choose the most
				affordable premiums, but it must be warned that
				some websites only show certain insurance
				companies and their products.

				It is important to find out who the website represents. In fact, some websites are owned by the same
				company that owns the insurance company and therefore only show the insurance products belonging
				to the insurance companies it owns. Remember also, that they may not show you all the policy
				conditions, such as exclusions or additional benefits, which will make comparing apples with apples
				difficult.

			<p>As we hinted above, insurance is not all about price.
				Each insurance product will have different features,
				benefits, costs and limitations. If you have a broker

					what?</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Remember, to always tell your insurer when
					anything that might change your risk changes,
					for example you move into a new house, you
					change jobs that needs you to travel more, etc.
					Which outlines your entire policy and all the
					benefits, exclusions (items you can’t claim for),
					features, excesses (the amount you have to pay
					for every claim), costs and limitations. These
					documents can be tricky and boring to read, but
					it is very important to read it. To get a summary
					of your policy you can read the “Schedule”, which
					will be included with your policy document.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Schedule is a summary of your policy
					including your premiums, the benefits you are
					entitled to claim for, any exclusions, excesses
					that you are required to pay for each claim, as
					well as the fees that your broker is earning (if
					you chose to use a broker). If you used a broker,
					ask them to explain the policy document to you.
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep your policy document and schedule in a
					safe place. If you ever need to claim, this is an
					important document that can guide you in
					finding out whether your insurer will cover you,
					and for how much. The more you know about
					your insurance policy, the more you know what
					your rights and responsibilities are.

			<ul>		
				<li>
					Most people would be happy to know that now that
					they are covered, they can sit back and relax, as all
					their risks have been transferred to the insurer.
					However, you should be an active policyholder and
					try and always remain on top of the insurance that
					you have bought. How can you do this? The first way
					is to ensure that your premiums are paid on time. If
					this isn’t the case, the insurer could cancel your
					cover, and when you try and claim you will get a
					nasty surprise of not being covered. One way to
					avoid this is to have monthly (or whatever frequency
					the premium payments are) debit orders so that you
					don’t forget to make payments to the insurer. The
					second item to stay on top of is keeping your policy
					up-to-date. For example, if you purchased a motor
					insurance policy for your car, and have recently
					moved houses and will now be driving in a different
					suburb, it is very important to tell your insurer
					about this. This is because an insurer may not pay
					out a claim if your situation has changed and you
					haven’t told them about it. It is possible that
					because you have moved the risk that the insurer is
					covering has changed, but because you haven’t told
					them they are charging the wrong premium.
					Therefore the premium does not equal the risk
					anymore. Remember, to always tell your insurer
					when anything that might change your risk changes,
					for example you move into a new house, you change
					jobs that needs you to travel more, etc. The third
					and most important item to be on top of is your
					policy document. This is a legal document•

				You’ve bought insurance, have paid your
				premiums, you understand your policy document
				and have kept your insurer up-to- date regarding
				any changes that may affect your policy. Then
				the unthinkable happens: an accident, theft or
				other loss happens, and you need to claim from
				your insurer. Don’t panic; if you follow the steps
				below you should be in the same position you
				were in before the unfortunate incident in no
				time at all.<br><br>
				
				Have a look at your policy document, this will let
				you know if you are able to claim, and what you
				may need in the event of claiming. For example,
				if you have bought travel insurance and your
				flight has been delayed, you may need to get a
				signed statement from the airline giving the
				reason for the delay. By reading your policy
				document you will know that you need this, and
				will be able to get the statement from the airline
				before you leave the airport. Without this, the
				insurer may not pay out the claim (again, check
				your policy document wording to confirm this).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 consumer6Right">
			<p>
				Call, email or submit your claim online if the
				insurer caters for this. Tell them you have to
				submit a claim and what they require from you.
				Usually legal documentation, police records,
				witness statements, images etc. will be needed
				for some claims. This is not to make the process
				difficult and burdensome for you. It is to make
				sure that your claim is genuine. There is a huge
				amount of fraud in the insurance industry and
				the insurer needs to be sure it is paying out a
				legitimate claim. And that’s it! Get a
				reference or claim number from the insurer so
				that you can track the claim. In the event of a
				claim, an assessor may be appointed to assess
				the loss or damage and confirm that the claim
				is valid.<br><br>
				
				The claim can be paid in cash, or the damaged
				or lost items can be repaired or replaced. An
				assessor will typically take into account the
				whole sum insured to determine the amount to
				be paid for the specific damaged or lost item. In
				the case of under insurance the insurance
				company will only pay part of the claim.

				company will usually charge for such special deals or bonuses. The charge may not be immediately
				apparent, but it is up to you or your broker to decide whether the premiums you are paying and
				benefits you are receiving are worth the bonuses you are being offered. In short, you should not take
				out an insurance policy based solely on the bonuses that the insurer is offering. The most important
				thing to consider is whether the insurance policy as a whole, works for you.

			<h3>How do I reduce my premiums?</h3>
			<p>
				Ask your insurer. This is a question they would be more than happy to answer. Sometimes doing
				something a little different, like only allowing yourself to drive your vehicle, can reduce your premium.
				Also adding a tracker to your car can reduce your motor insurance premiums. Other things you can do,
				is ensure you have burglar bars on all windows, security gates on all doors and a burglar alarm with
				armed response. Anything that the insurer would perceive as reducing your risk of claiming should
				reduce the premium you are being charged.

			<h3>Why all the intrusive questions?</h3>
			<p>
				Your insurer wants to know enough about you so that they can accept your own risks. The more information
				they have about you, the better they understand your risk and the more accurately they can charge you
				premiums that reflect your risk to them.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 space13020 ClaimFraud">
			<h3>What is a fraudulent claim?</h3>
			<p>
				A fraudulent claim is a claim that is
				made to an insurer about an event that
				didn’t happen. It is also fraudulent to
				give the wrong details about a claim
				that happened to your insurer. This can
				be summarised as follows:

	<div class="row space13020 yellowbg claimIssures ">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>
				<b>i) Claiming for something that was not lost</b><br>
				(e.g. an item was claimed to be in the boot of your stolencar when it wasn’t)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>ii) Overstating what was lost</b><br>
				(e.g. inflating the true worth of an item that is being claimed for, for example claiming for a R9 000 t.v.
				when your t.v. was only worth R3 000.00)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>iii) Adjusting the circumstance of what was lost</b><br>
				(e.g. claiming that someone hit your car when you in fact bumped into them)
			</p>
			<p>
				Insurance fraud has a devastating effect on the industry and works to increase the premiums that are paid
				by EVERY policyholder. So whether you think it effects only the insurer, be aware that it will affect the
				premiums you are charged for the next policy you take and the premiums of your friends and family

	<div class="row space13020 excessData">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
			Many policies include an excess. This is the
			amount you have to pay if you decide to make a
			claimon your policy. It’s a way of you accepting a
			small portion of the risk yourself. The amount of
			the excess is specified in your policy.<br><br>
			
			Insurance would be more expensive if the
			companies had to pay for EVERY loss a person
			experiences. So, insurance companies offer
			policies with varying levels of excess. An excess
			is the amount that you have to pay before your
			insurance kicks in. For example, if you have a
			homeowner’s policy with a R5 000.00 excess and
			your bike is stolen, chances are that you won’t
			ask the insurance company to pay you for your
			loss or “make a claim” because the bike cost
			less than R5 000.00. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
				That saves the insurance company time and money
				and keeps premiums that everyone pays lower.
				However, if you have the same excess on your
				motor insurance and your car is stolen, you will
				only pay up to R5 000.00 excess and they’ll repair,
				replace or reimburse you for your loss, depending
				on the terms of your insurance. Because excesses
				lower costs and administrative burden for
				insurance companies, policies with higher
				excesses are usually less expensive.<br><br>
	
				Not every type of policy has the same kind and
				level of excess and excesses don’t all apply in the
				same situations. Your insurer may have different
				types of excesses and some policies may have
				more than one
